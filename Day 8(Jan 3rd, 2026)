//Closures example

function createCounter() {
  let x = 0; // private variable

  function display() {
    return ++x;
  }

  return display;
}

const counter = createCounter();

counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
counter(); // 3

Why This Is a Closure (Explain This Confidently)

Say this in interviews 👇

“display forms a closure over the variable x.
Even after createCounter finishes execution, display still has access to x due to lexical scoping.
This allows data privacy because x cannot be accessed directly from outside.”

This explanation is exactly what interviewers expect.

Small Enhancement (Optional – Shows Senior Thinking)
function createCounter(start = 0) {
  let count = start;

  return function () {
    return ++count;
  };
}
