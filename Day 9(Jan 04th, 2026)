THIS keyword in Javascript:
const user = {
    name: "Kranthi", 
    greet(){ 
    console.log(this.name); 
    } 
}; 
user.greet(); // Kranthi
const greetFn = user.greet; 
greetFn(); //undefined
-----------------------------------------------
const greetFn = user.greet;
greetFn();
What actually happened?

You did this:
const greetFn = function() {
  console.log(this.name);
};

Now you call:
greetFn();

There is NO object before the dot.

So JS asks:

“Who is calling me?”

Answer:

“Nobody.”

So:

this = undefined   // in strict mode


Then:
this.name → undefined
⚠️ This is called context loss.
