// Automatic Batching in react:(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs/what-is-automatic-batching-in-react-18/)
Batching is a strategy for grouping multiple state updates before triggering a re-rendering a component.
This optimization is necessary because each re-render is computationally expensive.
Before React 18, Batching is limited to the state updates that occurred within React event handlers.
Here's a simple example:
function handleClick() {
  setCount(count + 1); // Update 1
  setIsVisible(true);  // Update 2
}
Here, React will batch the two state updates within same event handler and perform single re-render the component.
However, state updates originating outside event handlers, such as updates within Promises,timeouts and native event listeners(like addEventListener and removeEventListener) are not batched by default.

for Example:
setTimeout(()=>{
setCount(count+1); // Update 1
setIsVisible(true); // Update 2
},1000)

Here two re-renders will happen for two state updates inside setTimeout, without batching. This issue is solved by Automatic batching in react 18.

Automatic batching - In this, React batching extends beyond the event handlers.
In most of the cases, regardless of where state updates originates, react will attempt to batch it together with other pending updates.

Forcing a Re-render: At times, you might need to force a re-render immediately, bypassing the batching mechanism. React provides the flushSync utility for this:
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';

flushSync(() => {
  setCount(count + 1); 
});

React 18's useTransition hook:
It is designed for separating out urgent and non-urgent updates. Urgent updates(like responding to user input) should proceed as normal,
while non urgent updates(like fetching secondary data) marked as transitions. Automatic batching works in conjuction with these transitions to ensure smoother experiences.

Note: In hypothetical cases, React Automatic batching might not be applies to some old libraries, here we might leverage React's "unstable_batchedUpdates" API for finer control.
