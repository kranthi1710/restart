Approach:
Reverse the k characters in every 2k characters array
So split the array for every 2k elements of a string

var reverseStr = function(s, k) {
    let substr="";
    let subArr=[];
    let left=right=0;
    while(right<s.length){
        if(right===2*k){
            console.log("substr",substr);
            subArr.push(substr);
           
           
        }
        substr+=s[right];
        right++;
    }
    console.log(subArr);
};

reverseStr("abcdefg",2);
